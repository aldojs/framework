`Aldo` is a super fast micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs for Node.js 8+.

```js
const { Application } = require('aldo')

const app = new Application()

// add a request handler
app.use(() => 'Hello world!')

// create a HTTP server to serve the application
app.start(process.env.PORT)
```

## Request handlers

The request handlers take only one argument the [context](#context), which is a literal object holding everything you need to handle the incoming HTTP request.

```ts
// Handler function signature
declare type Handler = (ctx: Context) => any;
```

When the current handler has finished its job, the [context](#context) object is passed automatically to the next handler, and so on, till the last one.
To break that chain, just return `false` or `Promise<false>`.

```js
// to add a handler directly in the stack
app.use(handler)

// to compose multiple handlers into a single handler
app.use(fn1, fn2, ...)
```

You may be wondering, where is the `next` argument ?
`Aldo` doesn't provide it, only the [context](#context) is given.
The `next` function is invoked internally after the current handler has finished.

```js
// the `next` function is called immediately after a sync handler
app.use(({ req: { url, method } }) => {
  console.log(`incoming request: ${method} ${url}`)
})

// the `next` function is awaiting async functions
app.use(async (ctx) => {
  await fetch('some data from the DB')
})

// the `next` function is also awaiting sync functions returning promises
app.use((ctx) => {
  return fetch('some data from the DB')
})
```

## Error handlers

When an error is thrown during the request handling, it will be passed, in addition to the [context](#context), to each handler one by one, unless you return a `false` which will stop the error handling sequence.

```ts
// Handler function signature
declare type ErrorHandler = (err: any, ctx: Context) => any;
```

You may attach error handlers as many as needed with `.catch(fn)`.

```js
app.catch(errorHandler)
```

## Context

The context object is a simple plain object with only 2 mandatory properties: 
- `req` refers to the [IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object
- and `res` to the [ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object

```ts
declare interface Context {
  req: IncomingMessage;
  res: ServerResponse;
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

To extend the request context, and add shared properties, like a DB connection, or a global logger, you may use `.set(key, value)`

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test')

app.set('db', mongoose)
```

To set a per request private properties, you may use `.bind()`. This method takes a field name, and a function to be used as a `lazy` getter of the field value.

```js
app.bind('session', () => new Session(options))
```

This method is very useful, since it allows you to lazily (only when needed) attach a per request property into the context without adding a dedicated handler.

`.has(key)` and `.get(key)` are aldo available to check the existence of a certain field or to get a previously defined field value.
